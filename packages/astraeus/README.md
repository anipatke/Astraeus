# astraeus (the engine)

The part of Astraeus that has no story of its own. It is shipped as TypeScript source and built by the site that uses it (there is no build step here). It imports no other package in this repository.

## What it holds

| Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/core/` | Scientific core: clock, frames, bodies, providers and curve-fit state. No Three.js or React. |
| `src/assets/` | Body catalogue, compositions, visuals, rings and sky. |
| `src/app/` | The scene and app adapter (floating origin, camera, paths, labels, `App`). |
| `src/shell/` | The generic UI: shell, top bar, timeline, drawers, info panel, story panels. |
| `src/experiences/` | Shared helpers a demo builds on (settings reader, metrics, switch chooser). |
| `src/synthetic/` | Made-up experiences that prove the plug-in contract. |
| `data/`, `licenses/` | Core data (bodies, ephemerides, orbits) and the notices for the libraries it uses. |
| `tests/` | The engine's tests, plus helpers its demos' tests reuse. |

## How a demo plugs in

A demo is a package that depends on `astraeus`, builds an `ExperienceDefinition` (type in `src/app/experienceDefinition.ts`) from its own data, and is listed by the site. It imports the engine only through the package entries in `package.json` `exports` (for example `astraeus/app/experienceDefinition`), never by a relative path into this folder.

A complete small example with no real data is `src/synthetic/syntheticDefinition.ts`: a made-up object on a tilted loop with marks, events and story panels. Read it first; the site lists it as the `synthetic` experience (`packages/astraeus-site/src/main.tsx`).

The `exports` list is broad for now (one pattern per folder); a later Objective narrows it to the public API.

## Check it alone

From the repository root, `npm run check:engine-alone` copies this package and the shared config into a scratch folder with no demo or site, then type-checks, lints and tests it there. A file or import that reaches outside the package fails the run.
